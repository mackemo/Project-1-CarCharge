# project-1-charge-car

## Description

The first project from a bootcamp where a group of collaborators needed to come up with a real-world problem that could be solved with code. The problem being solved in this project is a way for electric car owners to quickly find a charging station to charge their car.

## User Story

- AS an electric car owner
- I WANT to find an easy route to a charging station
- SO THAT I can beat traffic and quickly get me car charged

## Acceptance Criteria

...

## Process

The process included finding two server-side apis that would help make this application. The APIs used are: OpenCharge, which is a map api for charging stations, and TomTom, which is a traffic locator api that finds the best route to a destination.
